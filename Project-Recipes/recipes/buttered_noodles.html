    <h4>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Noodles:
            This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.
        </li>

        <li>
            Butter:
            You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).
        </li>

        <li>
            Parmesan:
            Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.
        </li>

        <li>
            Salt and Pepper:
            Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.
        </li>
    </ul>
