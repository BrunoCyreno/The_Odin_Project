It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I will build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I'm finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; this project will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
