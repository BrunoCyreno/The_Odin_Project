    <h4>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.</li>
        <li>Onion – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
        <li>Red wine (or beef broth) – This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
        <li>Dried thyme – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li>Sugar – balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
        <li>Parsley – flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles – Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes.</li>
        <li>Cottage cheese – adds great texture and moisture</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese – we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese – An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
        <li>Egg – helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Brown the beef – Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
    <li>Finish the sauce – Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the cheese filling – Combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest for later).</li>
    <li>Prep – Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until al dente.</li>
    <li>Assemble – Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Bake – Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Rest – Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving.</li> 
    </ol>
